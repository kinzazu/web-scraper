This is the *Web Scraper* project I made myself.


<p>You will create a function that takes a website address and a number of webpages as input arguments and then goes all over the website saving every news article on the page to a separate .txt file on your computer.</p>

Here's the link to the project: https://hyperskill.org/projects/145
